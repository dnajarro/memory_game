functionality
start up page
    1 and 2 player buttons
    click (clears page)
game page
    show cards (facedown) and scores
    message with who's turn it is
in a turn:
    click on a box -> displays image
    click on second box -> displays image (PAUSE)
        if the same
            "remove" the card match (make background color)
            add score for that player
            (still that player's turn)
        if different
            both are flipped back over
            switches player
            
(one player: don't worry about switching turn, or displaying trun message)
keep track of number of turns and display (instead of message thing)            

two players
    whose turn
    score 1 
    score 2
one player
    number of turns
    score
both
    randomly initialize image locations (2 of each!)
    for each spot: which image, and if the card is still there
    array for storing cards -> look like GUI array of cards(?)
    clicking on a box calls a function (more on that) with param which box (number or index)
    using that number figures out which image is "there" and therefore to 
    
    ACTUALLY
    "card" object
        which image
        bools: showing, stillThere
        
        
        
Initializing the array
    have a list of 2 of each of the image values
    make an array full of 0s
    randomly pick array indicies
        check if 0 (if not it's already a card)
            add card: assign image value, booleans
        if not 0: go try again
        
        
Start of the game:
    initialize the array
    scores =0
    have it be someone's turn
    display scores and turn message
Click:
    call a flip function passing some kind of position identifier
        if image is there
            if image is NOT showing
                get the image to display and display it 
                see if there is another card showing
                    (PAUSE if necessary)
                    check the image values to see if the same
                        if the same
                            "remove" the card match (make background color) and change exists value
                            add score for that player
                            (still that player's turn)
                            if array contains any card that exist, continue
                            else game over
                        if different
                            both are flipped back over and "show" values changed
                            switches player AND adds turn count
                else do nothing
            else do nothing
        else do nothing
